# Oskar Kandare

#### Oskar Kandare

5.6.2000\
I am a college student of MA Visual Communication Design at the Academy of Fine Art and Design, Ljubljana. My research focuses on Apocalypse, The End, and the Anthropocene Epoch. The medium of my work is photography and New Media. I would like the spectator to wonder about the times in which we live.
